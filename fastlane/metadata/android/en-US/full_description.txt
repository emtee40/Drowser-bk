Avoid rogue apps from running in the background with Drowser.

Drowser is a simple app that kills the selected apps when the screen turns off.

It requires root and uses it to kill the apps with an 'am force-stop <app-id>'. This is a **very** impolite way of stopping apps. These might (and probably will) misbehave. You might also lose data because of this. **Beware!**
