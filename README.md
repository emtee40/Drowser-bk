# Drowser

Avoid rogue apps from running in the background with Drowser.

Drowser is a simple app that kills the apps you select when the screen turns off.

It requires root and uses it to kill the apps with an `am force-stop <app-id>`. This is a *very* impolite way of stopping apps. These might (and will probably) misbehave. You might also lose data because of this. **Beware!**
